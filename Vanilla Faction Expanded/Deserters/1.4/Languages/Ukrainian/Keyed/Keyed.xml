Equipped with advanced sensors and targeting systems, the aerodrone can detect and track targets from great distances. Once a target has been identified, the aerodrone will unleash a devastating salvo of precision rockets, each one designed to cause maximum damage and destruction.

The slicer beams fire down from the sky, creating a web of energy that systematically levels everything in its path. The terrain itself seems to buckle and heave as the beams slice through the earth, leaving behind deep crevices and rubble-filled craters. People, vehicles, and even buildings are reduced to nothing more than dust and ash in a matter of seconds. The air itself is superheated by the intense energy of the beams, creating a blast wave that can travel for miles.
There is no escape from the Divine Inferno. Those caught in its path are instantly vaporized, leaving behind nothing but charred remnants of what was once there. Even underground shelters are no match for the destructive power of the slicer beams, as they cut through the earth like a hot knife through butter.
The aftermath of Divine Inferno is a wasteland of destruction. The landscape is unrecognizable, with little more than rubble and ash as far as the eye can see. The air is still thick with the acrid smell of burnt flesh and melting metal. The once-thriving colony is now nothing more than a scorched and lifeless husk.-->
