  <VFED_DeserterEndgame.questDescriptionRules.rulesStrings.0>questDescription-&gt;[noble_nameFull] is the Emperor of the [empire_name]. An egocentric ruler who values tradition over the lives of [noble_possessive] people, [noble_pronoun] has to be stopped at all costs. [noble_pronoun] refuses to adapt to the new reality post-Sophiamunda Shattering, and instead insists on maintaining old ways, leading to the wasteful loss of countless lives.\n\n\nDespite the warnings we have given [noble_objective] and the obvious signs of impending doom, [noble_pronoun] remains obstinate in [noble_possessive] ways, driving the Empire towards certain destruction. The only hope for the deserters is to take out the Imperial flagship in orbit, which gives the Emperor an overwhelming military advantage.\n\n\nIn order to do that, we have to take control of three Zeus cannons located in various places on the planet. This mission needs to be executed on all fronts simultaneously, as we will only have a limited window of opportunity once the first Zeus cannon is taken. Activating all three of them at the same time will ensure the total obliteration of the Imperial flagship, after which the Empire will have no choice but to dissolve.</VFED_DeserterEndgame.questDescriptionRules.rulesStrings.0>
